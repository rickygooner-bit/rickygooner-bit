# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Marty**, a game designer and coder based in Australia.

I design and build whatever comes to mind.  
If an idea hits me, I’ll prototype it, break it, rebuild it, and ship it.

My current stack is **React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Framer Motion**.  
I also code in **Python, HTML/CSS**, and I like experimenting with **AI — automation, generation, and weird projects**.

I enjoy building **Minecraft abilities, plugins, and modded systems**, as well as random projects that shouldn’t exist but absolutely do.
